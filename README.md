* [Explainable AI](http://cdn.bdigital.org/PDF/BDC18/BDC18_ExplainableAI.pdf); Ricardo	Baeza-Yates; Big Data Congress 2018
* [Trust and explainability: The relationship between humans & AI](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~tobo/AI_chora2.pdf); Thomas Bolander;  The measure of success for AI applications is the value they create for human lives. In that light, they should be designed to enable people to understand AI systems successfully, participate in their use, and build their trust. AI technologies already pervade our lives. As they become a central force in society, the field is shifting from simply building systems that are intelligent to building intelligent systems that are human-aware and trustworthy.
* [21 fairness definitions and their politics](https://fairmlbook.org/tutorial2.html); This tutorial has two goals. The first is to explain the technical definitions. In doing so, I will aim to make explicit the values embedded in each of them. This will help policymakers and others better understand what is truly at stake in debates about fairness criteria (such as individual fairness versus group fairness, or statistical parity versus error-rate equality). It will also help com­puter scientists recognize that the proliferation of definitions is to be celebrated, not shunned, and that the search for one true definition is not a fruitful direction, as technical considerations cannot adjudicate moral debates.

* [MAGMIL: Model Agnostic Methods for Interpretable Machine Learning](https://github.com/ankitbit/MAGMIL); European Unionâ€™s new General Data Protection Regulation which is going to be enforced beginning from 25th of May, 2018 will have potential impact on the routine use of machine learning algorithms by restricting automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which â€significantly affectâ€ users. The law will also effectively create a â€right to explanation,â€ whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. Considering such challenging norms on the use of machine learning systems, we are making an attempt to make the models more interpretable. While we are concerned about developing a deeper understanding of decisions made by a machine learning model, the idea of extracting the explaintations from the machine learning system, also known as model-agnostic interpretability methods has some benefits over techniques such as model specific interpretability methods in terms of flexibility.

* [A toolbox to iNNvestigate neural networks' predictions!](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate); Maximilian Alber; In the recent years neural networks furthered the state of the art in many domains like, e.g., object detection and speech recognition.

In the attempt to understand neural networks better several methods were proposed, e.g., Saliency, Deconvnet, GuidedBackprop, SmoothGrad, IntergratedGradients, LRP, PatternNet&-Attribution. Due to the lack of a reference implementations comparing them is a major effort.

That is a datset containing nearly 40,000 unique categories. How would you deal with that kind of data if you planned to do predictive modelling? One hot encoding doesn't get you anywhere useful, since that would add 40,000 sparse variables to your dataset. Throwing the data out could be leaving valuable information on the table, so that doesn't seem right either. In this post, I'm going to examine how to deal with categorical variables with high cardinality using a stratey called impact encoding. To illustrate this example, I use a data set containing used car sales. The probelm is especially well suited because there are several categorical features with many levels. Let's get started.

Of the talks I went to, there were two main areas of research that seem to be on a lot of peopleâ€™s minds: Firstly, finding a meaningful representation of graph structures to feed into neural networks. Oriol Vinyalsfrom DeepMind gave a talk about their Message Passing Neural Networks.  The second area, and the focus of this article, are explainable AI models. As we generate newer and more innovative applications for neural networks, the question of â€˜How do they work?â€™ becomes more and more important.

* [Derisking machine learning and artificial intelligence ](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/derisking-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence); Machine learning and artificial intelligence are set to transform the banking industry, using vast amounts of data to build models that improve decision making, tailor services, and improve risk management. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, this could generate value of more than $250 billion in the banking industry. But there is a downside, since machine-learning models amplify some elements of model risk. And although many banks, particularly those operating in jurisdictions with stringent regulatory requirements, have validation frameworks and practices in place to assess and mitigate the risks associated with traditional models, these are often insufficient to deal with the risks associated with machine-learning models. Conscious of the problem, many banks are proceeding cautiously, restricting the use of machine-learning models to low-risk applications, such as digital marketing. Their caution is understandable given the potential financial, reputational, and regulatory risks. Banks could, for example, find themselves in violation of antidiscrimination laws, and incur significant finesâ€”a concern that pushed one bank to ban its HR department from using a machine-learning rÃ©sumÃ© screener. A better approach, however, and ultimately the only sustainable one if banks are to reap the full benefits of machine-learning models, is to enhance model-risk management.
* [Explainable AI should help us avoid a third 'AI winter'](https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/opinion/3073390/explainable-ai-should-help-us-avoid-a-third-ai-winter); The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into force last year across Europe has rightly made consumers and businesses more aware of personal data. However, there is a real risk that through over-correcting around data collection critical AI development will be negatively impacted. This is not only an issue for data scientists, but also those companies that use AI-based solutions to increase competitiveness. The potential negative impact would not only be on businesses implementing AI but also on consumers who may miss out on the benefits AI could bring to the products and services they rely on.
* [Explainable AI: From Prediction To Understanding](https://medium.com/@ODSC/explainable-ai-from-prediction-to-understanding-38c81c11460); Itâ€™s not enough to make predictions. Sometimes, you need to generate a deep understanding. Just because you model something doesnâ€™t mean you really know how it works. In classical machine learning, the algorithm spits out predictions, but in some cases, this isnâ€™t good enough. Dr. George Cevora explains why the black box of AI may not always be appropriate and how to go from prediction to understanding.
* [Why Explainable AI (XAI) is the future of marketing and e-commerce](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2019/03/11/what-is-explainable-ai-xai/); â€œNew machine-learning systems will have the ability to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future.â€ â€“ David Gunning, Head of DARPA. As machine learning begins to play a greater role in the delivery of personalized customer experiences in commerce and content, one of the most powerful opportunities is the development of systems that offer marketers the ability to maximize every dollar spent on marketing programs via actionable insights. But the rise of AI in business for actionable insights also creates a challenge: How can marketers know and trust the reasoning behind why an AI system is making recommendations for action? Because AI makes decisions using incredibly complex processes, its decisions are often opaque to the end-user.
* [Interpretable AI or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust AI](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-ai-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-trust-ai-e61f9e8ee2c2) Techniques to build Robust, Unbiased AI Applications; Ajay Thampi; In the last five years alone, AI researchers have made significant breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language understanding and board games! As companies are considering handing over critical decisions to AI in industries like healthcare and finance, the lack of understanding of complex machine learned models is hugely problematic. This lack of understanding could result in models propagating bias and weâ€™ve seen quite a few examples of this in criminal justice, politics, retail, facial recognition and language understanding.
* [In Search of Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/in-search-of-explainable-artificial-intelligence/); Today, if a new entrepreneur wants to understand why the banks rejected a loan application for his start-up, or if a young graduate wants to know why the large corporation for which he was hoping to work did not invite her for an interview, they will not be able to discover the reasons that led to these decisions. Both the bank and the corporation used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to determine the outcome of the loan or the job application. In practice, this means that if your loan application is rejected, or your CV rejected, no explanation can be provided. This produces an embarrassing scenario, which tends to relegate AI technologies to suggesting solutions, which must be validated by human beings.
* [Explainable AI and the Rebirth of Rules](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2019/03/18/explainable-ai-and-the-rebirth-of-rules/); Artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as a set of â€œprediction machines.â€ In general, the technology is great at generating automated predictions. But if you want to use artificial intelligence in a regulated industry, you better be able to explain how the machine predicted a fraud or criminal suspect, a bad credit risk, or a good candidate for drug trials. International law firm Taylor Wessing (the firm) wanted to use AI as a triage tool to help advise clients of the firm about their predicted exposure to regulations such as the Modern Slavery Act or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Clients often have suppliers or acquisitions around the world, and they need systematic due diligence to determine where they should investigate more deeply into possible risk. Supply chains can be especially complicated with hundreds of small suppliers. Rumors of Rule Enginesâ€™ Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated
* [Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/); Here we discuss "threshold classifiers," a part of some machine learning systems that is critical to issues of discrimination. A threshold classifier essentially makes a yes/no decision, putting things in one category or another. We look at how these classifiers work, ways they can potentially be unfair, and how you might turn an unfair classifier into a fairer one. As an illustrative example, we focus on loan granting scenarios where a bank may grant or deny a loan based on a single, automatically computed number such as a credit score.

* [Machine Learning is Creating a Crisis in Science](https://www.governmentciomedia.com/machine-learning-creating-crisis-science); Kevin McCaney; The adoption of machine-learning techniques is contributing to a worrying number of research findings that cannot be repeated by other researchers.
* [Artificial Intelligence and Ethics](https://harvardmagazine.com/2019/01/artificial-intelligence-limitations); Jonathan Shaw; On march 2018, at around 10 P.M., Elaine Herzberg was wheeling her bicycle across a street in Tempe, Arizona, when she was struck and killed by a self-driving car. Although there was a human operator behind the wheel, an autonomous systemâ€”artificial intelligenceâ€”was in full control. This incident, like others involving interactions between people and AI technologies, raises a host of ethical and proto-legal questions. What moral obligations did the systemâ€™s programmers have to prevent their creation from taking a human life? And who was responsible for Herzbergâ€™s death? The person in the driverâ€™s seat? The company testing the carâ€™s capabilities? The designers of the AI system, or even the manufacturers of its onboard sensory equipment?
* [Building Trusted Human-Machine Partnerships](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-01-31); A key ingredient in effective teams â€“ whether athletic, business, or military â€“ is trust, which is based in part on mutual understanding of team membersâ€™ competence to fulfill assigned roles. When it comes to forming effective teams of humans and autonomous systems, humans need timely and accurate insights about their machine partnersâ€™ skills, experience, and reliability to trust them in dynamic environments. At present, autonomous systems cannot provide real-time feedback when changing conditions such as weather or lighting cause their competency to fluctuate. The machinesâ€™ lack of awareness of their own competence and their inability to communicate it to their human partners reduces trust and undermines team effectiveness.
* [HOW AUGMENTED ANALYTICS AND EXPLAINABLE AI WILL CAUSE A DISRUPTION IN 2019 & BEYOND](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/here-is-how-augmented-analytics-and-explainable-ai-will-cause-a-disruption-in-2019-beyond/); Kamalika Some; Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformational $15 trillion opportunity which has caught the attention of all tech users, leaders and influencers. Yet, as AI becomes more sophisticated, the algorithmic â€˜black boxâ€™ dominates more to make all the decisions. To have a confident outcome and stakeholder trust with an ultimate aim to capitalise on the opportunities, it is essential to know the rationale of how the algorithm arrived at its recommendation or decision, the basic premise behind Explainable AI (XAI).
* [Why â€˜Explainable AIâ€™ is the Next Frontier in Financial Crime Fighting ](http://www.bankingexchange.com/news-feed/item/7785-why-explainable-ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-financial-crime-fighting); Chad Hetherington; Financial institutions (FIs) must manage compliance budgets without losing sight of primary functions and quality control. To answer this, many have made the move to automating time-intensive, rote tasks like data gathering and sorting through alerts by adopting innovative technologies like AI and machine learning to free up time-strapped analysts for more informed and precise decision-making processes.
* [Machine Learning Interpretability: Do You Know What Your Model Is Doing?](https://www.inovex.de/blog/machine-learning-interpretability/); Marcel Spitzer; With the adoption of GDPR, there are now EU-wide regulations concerning automated individual decision-making and profiling (Art. 22, also termed â€žright to explanationâ€œ), engaging companies to give individuals information about processing, to introduce ways for them to request intervention and to even carry out regular checks to make sure that the systems are working as intended. 
* [Building explainable machine learning models](https://www.fastdatascience.com/2019/02/08/building-explainable-machine-learning-models/); Thomas Wood; Sometimes as data scientists we will encounter cases where we need to build a machine learning model that should not be a black box, but which should make transparent decisions that humans can understand. This can go against our instincts as scientists and engineers, as we would like to build the most accurate model possible.
* [AI is not IT](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-silvie-spreeuwenberg); Silvie Spreeuwenberg; XAI suggests something in between. It is still narrow AI but used in such a way that there is a feedback loop to the environment. The feedback loop may involve human intervention. We understand the scope of the narrow AI solution. We can adjust the solution when the task at hand requires more knowledge, or are warned in a meaningful way when the task at hand does not fit in the scope of the AI solution.

* [Boston University researchers develop framework to improve AI fairness](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/30/boston-university-researchers-develop-framework-to-improve-ai-fairness/); Experience in the past few years shows AI algorithms can manifest gender and racial bias, raising concern over their use in critical domains, such as deciding whose loan gets approved, whoâ€™s qualified for a job, who gets to walk free and who stays in prison. New research by scientists at Boston University shows just how hard it is to evaluate fairness in AI algorithms and tries to establish a framework for detecting and mitigating problematic behavior in automated decisions. Titled â€œFrom Soft Classifiers to Hard Decisions: How fair can we be?,â€ the research paper is being presented this week at the Association for Computing Machinery conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAT*).

### 2018

* [Understanding Explainable AI](https://www.quantiply.com/blog/understanding-explainable-ai); (Extracted from The Basis Technology Handbook for Integrating AI in Highly Regulated Industries) For the longest time, the public perception of AI has been linked to visions of the apocalypse: AI is Skynet, and we should be afraid of it. You can see that fear in the reactions to the Uber self-driving car tragedy. Despite the fact that people cause tens of thousands of automobile deaths per year, it strikes a nerve when even a single accident involves AI. This fear belies something very important about the technical infrastructure of the modern world: AI is already thoroughly baked in. Thatâ€™s not to say that there arenâ€™t reasons to get skittish about our increasing reliance on AI technology. The â€œblack boxâ€ problem is one such justified reason for hesitation.
* [The Importance of Human Interpretable Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/human-interpretable-machine-learning-part-1-the-need-and-importance-of-model-interpretation-2ed758f5f476); This article is the first in my series of articles aimed at â€˜Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)â€™. The field of Artificial Intelligence powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning has gone through some phenomenal changes over the last decade. Starting off as just a pure academic and research-oriented domain, we have seen widespread industry adoption across diverse domains including retail, technology, healthcare, science and many more. Rather than just running lab experiments to publish a research paper, the key objective of data science and machine learning in the 21st century has changed to tackling and solving real-world problems, automating complex tasks and making our life easier and better. More than often, the standard toolbox of machine learning, statistical or deep learning models remain the same. New models do come into existence like Capsule Networks, but industry adoption of the same usually takes several years. Hence, in the industry, the main focus of data science or machine learning is more â€˜appliedâ€™ rather than theoretical and effective application of these models on the right data to solve complex real-world problems is of paramount importance.
* [Uber Has Open-Sourced Autonomous Vehicle Visualization](https://www.designnews.com/design-hardware-software/uber-has-open-sourced-autonomous-vehicle-visualization/38672905960296); With an open source version of its Autonomous Visualization System, Uber is hoping to create a standard visualization system for engineers to use in autonomous vehicle development.

Better Decision Making as explanation provides added info and confidence for Man-in-Middle to act wisely and decisively. Gives a sense of Control as an AI system owner clearly knows levers for its AI systemâ€™s behavior and boundary. Gives a sense of Safety as each decision can be subjected to pass through safety guidelines and alerts on its violation. Build Trust with stakeholders who can see through all the reasoning of each and every decision made. Monitor for Ethical issues and violation due to bias in training data. Better mechanism to comply with Accountability requirements within the organization for auditing and other purposes. Better adherence to Regulatory requirements (like GDPR) where â€˜Right to Explainâ€™ is must-have for a system.
* [Artificial Intelligence Is Not A Technology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/11/01/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-technology/);  Kathleen Walch; Making intelligent machines is both the goal of AI as well as the underlying science behind understanding what it takes to make a machine intelligent. AI represents our desired outcome and many of the developments along the way of that understanding such as self-driving vehicles, image recognition technology, or natural language processing and generation are steps along the journey to AGI.

To get reliable results in Python, use permutation importance, provided here and in our rfpimp package (via pip). For R, use importance=T in the Random Forest constructor then type=1 in R's importance() function. In addition, your feature importance measures will only be reliable if your model is trained with suitable hyper-parameters.

* [Regulating Black-Box Medicine](http://michiganlawreview.org/regulating-black-box-medicine/); Data drive modern medicine. And our tools to analyze those data are growing ever more powerful. As health data are collected in greater and greater amounts, sophisticated algorithms based on those data can drive medical innovation, improve the process of care, and increase efficiency. Those algorithms, however, vary widely in quality. Some are accurate and powerful, while others may be riddled with errors or based on faulty science. When an opaque algorithm recommends an insulin dose to a diabetic patient, how do we know that dose is correct? Patients, providers, and insurers face substantial difficulties in identifying high-quality algorithms; they lack both expertise and proprietary information. How should we ensure that medical algorithms are safe and effective?

* [3 Signs of a Good AI Model](https://tdwi.org/articles/2018/11/26/adv-all-3-signs-of-a-good-ai-model.aspx); Troy Hiltbrand; Until recently, the success of an AI project was judged only by its outcomes for the company, but an emerging industry trend suggests another goal -- explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The gravitation toward XAI stems from demand from consumers (and ultimately society) to better understand how AI decisions are made. Regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, have increased the demand for more accountability when AI is used to make automated decisions, especially in cases where bias has a detrimental effect on individuals.

* [Rapid new advances are now underway in AI](https://www.technative.io/why-its-important-to-create-a-movement-around-explainable-ai/); Yet, as AI gets more widely deployed, the importance of having explainable models will increase. Simply, if systems are responsible for making a decision, there comes a step in the process whereby that decision has to be shown â€” communicating what the decision is, how it was made and â€“ now â€“ why did the AI do what it did.

* [Why We Need to Audit Algorithms](https://hbr.org/2018/11/why-we-need-to-audit-algorithms); James Guszcza Iyad Rahwan Will Bible Manuel Cebrian Vic Katyal; Algorithmic decision-making and artificial intelligence (AI) hold enormous potential and are likely to be economic blockbusters, but we worry that the hype has led many people to overlook the serious problems of introducing algorithms into business and society. Indeed, we see many succumbing to what Microsoftâ€™s Kate Crawford calls â€œdata fundamentalismâ€ â€” the notion that massive datasets are repositories that yield reliable and objective truths, if only we can extract them using machine learning tools. A more nuanced view is needed. It is by now abundantly clear that, left unchecked, AI algorithms embedded in digital and social technologies can encode societal biases, accelerate the spread of rumors and disinformation, amplify echo chambers of public opinion, hijack our attention, and even impair our mental wellbeing.

Black defendants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of recidivism than they actually were. Our analysis found that black defendants who did not recidivate over a two-year period were nearly twice as likely to be misclassified as higher risk compared to their white counterparts (45 percent vs. 23 percent). The analysis also showed that even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were 45 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants.
